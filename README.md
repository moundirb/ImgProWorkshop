# 🖼️ Image Processing Workshop  

Notebooks from our **Image Processing Workshop** where we played around with cool image processing techniques and object detection! 🚀  

## 🔹 What We Did  
✅ Applied **filters, noise reduction, rotation, histograms, and morphological operations** using **Matplotlib, NumPy, and OpenCV**.

✅ Tried **object detection** on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** using **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** from Scikit-Learn.  

## 🔧 Tools Used  
🔹 `matplotlib`  
🔹 `numpy`  
🔹 `opencv-python (cv2)`  
🔹 `scikit-learn`
